This math project explores various aspects of Kerala, a state located on India's southwestern coast. We examine Kerala's geography, including its coordinates and coastal stretch along the Arabian Sea. The project highlights the state's abundant mineral resources and diverse agricultural sector, focusing on major crops like rice, coconut, rubber, tea, coffee, and spices. Additionally, we analyze the population data, comparing the census information from 2011 and 2022, which provides insights into population growth, literacy rates, and religious composition. This project offers a concise overview of Kerala's geography, resources, agriculture, and population dynamics.
