I, Aayush Patre, a 10th-grade student at Maharishi Vidya Mandir, Mangla, express my gratitude to all who assisted me in completing my project on 'Art-Integrating Chhattisgarh with Kerala under Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' for my CBSE curriculum.

Firstly, I thank my art teacher, Mrs. Pallavi Singh, for her invaluable guidance and feedback throughout the project, shaping my understanding.

I also acknowledge the contributions of artists and scholars whose work I referenced, deepening my knowledge of Chhattisgarh and Kerala's art forms and their integration potential.

Lastly, I extend sincere thanks to the CBSE board and the Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat scheme for providing this captivating opportunity.

Thank you.
