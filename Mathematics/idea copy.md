Kerala has a coastline stretching approximately 590 kilometers (367 miles) along the Arabian Sea, accounting for about 9% of India's total coastline. The land area of Kerala is about 38,863 square kilometers (15,005 square miles). This makes up approximately 1.18% of India's total land area.

The state is characterized by its unique network of backwaters, encompassing around 1,900 kilometers (1,181 miles) of interconnected canals, rivers, and lakes. Kerala's land is rich in natural resources, with forests covering approximately 29% of the state's total area.

### B. Resources:
Kerala boasts an estimated 400 million tonnes of mineral resources, including abundant reserves of laterite, limestone, quartzite, sandstone, granite, shale, gypsum, and mica. While bauxite, china clay, and heavy mineral sand are less plentiful, these resources are vital for various industries. Kerala's construction sector relies on limestone, sandstone, and granite for infrastructure projects, while the manufacturing industry utilizes bauxite, china clay, and quartzite in the production of ceramics, paper, and glass. The energy industry harnesses coal and lignite for electricity generation, and the agricultural sector benefits from gypsum and mica for enhancing soil quality and producing fertilizers. These mineral resources play a significant role in Kerala's economy, providing employment opportunities and generating revenue for both the state and national governments. Furthermore, they support the export of various products to international markets, making them a valuable asset for the state and the nation.
