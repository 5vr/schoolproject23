I, Aayush Patre, a student of Class 10th 'C' at Maharishi Vidya Mandir, Mangla, would like to express my gratitude to everyone who helped me complete my project on 'Art-Integrating Chhattisgarh with Kerala under Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' as a part of my CBSE board curriculum.

Firstly, I would like to thank my art teacher, Mrs. Suvrata Tiwari, for providing me with valuable guidance and feedback throughout the project. Her inputs have been instrumental in shaping my understanding of the subject.

I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of various artists and scholars whose work I have referenced in my project. Their research and scholarship have helped me gain a deeper understanding of the art forms of Chhattisgarh and Kerala and their potential for integration.

Lastly, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the CBSE board and the Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat scheme for providing me with the opportunity to explore this fascinating topic.

Thank you.
