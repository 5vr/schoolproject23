In conclusion, the Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat scheme has brought together the cultural traditions of Chhattisgarh and Kerala. Through the exploration of folk music, historical places, and folk dances, we have learned about the rich cultural heritage of both regions. The scheme has encouraged us to celebrate our cultural diversity and promote national unity and integration.
