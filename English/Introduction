# Introduction

The project, "Art-Integrating Chhattisgarh with Kerala under 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat'," is an English assignment that explores the cultural connections between Chhattisgarh and Kerala. With a focus on historical places, folk dances, and folk music, the project aims to showcase both the similarities and differences between these two diverse states.

Through this endeavor, we aim to celebrate the rich heritage of India by connecting these regions under the banner of "Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat" (One India, Great India). By delving into the captivating realms of art, we uncover the unique expressions of culture that have flourished in Chhattisgarh and Kerala.
